# osu-player-tools

Some very simple and dirty tools for playing osu! songs in terminal.

`RealmHashExtractor` uses code from <https://github.com/ookiineko/CollectionDowngrader> (and thus <https://github.com/ppy/osu/>).

## TODOs

- [ ] Add a proper README.
- [ ] Code cleanup (currently it is done rushy and messy).
- [ ] Show correct metadata in mpris.
- [ ] TUI support.
